> Embed your NFTs anywhere and everywhere

infinite-nft is a react component for embedding a grid containing all of your NFTs. The component just-in-time loads elements of the grid so that
whoever is viewing has an 'infinite' scroll experience. Huge shoutout to the OpenSea API for making this library possible.

## Install

```bash
# Yarn
yarn add infinite-nft

# NPM
npm install --save infinite-nft
```

## Example usage

The snippet below shows a basic example of how the `InfiniteNFT` component can be used. We suggest wrapping it in an absolutely positioned element that
takes up 100% of both the height and width of the screen for the best viewing and scrolling experience.

```js
<div
    style={{
        width: '100%',
        height: '100%',
        position: 'absolute',
    }}
>
    <InfiniteNFT
        address={'0x82c1b61da09b5fdce098a212bb8070210ab91049'}
        gutter={170}
    />
</div>
```
